          <h4 class="padtop2">Research Overview</h4>

          <p class="text1">
            My research focuses on understanding and mitigating the effects of fire on the built
            environment across two complementary thrusts: <b>Structural Fire Engineering</b> and
            <b>Wildfire/WUI Engineering</b>. It investigates the mechanics of structural response,
            ignition vulnerability, and infrastructure-scale risk, forming a unified framework that
            links component-level behavior to community-scale resilience.
          </p>

          <p class="text1">
            Fire is among the most severe and complex hazards affecting buildings and urban
            environments—one increasingly amplified by climate change, drought, heatwaves,
            and the expanding wildland–urban interface (WUI). In 2022, more than 522,000 structure
            fires occurred in the United States, causing an estimated US $15 billion in direct losses.
            The 2025 Los Angeles wildfires—including the Palisades and Eaton Fires—damaged over
            12,300 structures and produced insured losses exceeding US $20 billion, underscoring the
            urgent need for science-based, multi-scale fire resilience strategies.
          </p>

          <h4 class="padtop2">Research Vision</h4>

          <p class="text1">
            My work integrates structural mechanics, fire dynamics, and data science to develop
            performance-based, climate-aware fire engineering tools. A central goal is to couple
            detailed modeling of heat transfer and structural response with community-scale
            wildfire exposure and infrastructure vulnerability, enabling fire-resilient and
            low-carbon design solutions at multiple scales.
          </p>

          <p class="text1">
            A particular emphasis is on <b>structure-to-structure fire spread</b> in the WUI.
            Current codes largely address vegetation-to-structure ignition, but once a building
            ignites, its long-duration radiative output dominates local fire behavior. Timber-framed
            structures can burn for hours, releasing 2–3× the energy of the interior fuel load alone.
            My research quantifies these effects through fragility functions linking ignition
            probability to radiant heat flux, ember density, exposure duration, and building geometry.
          </p>

          <h4 class="padtop2">Three Core Research Directions</h4>

          <p class="text1">
            <b>(1) Computational Fire Mechanics</b><br>
            I develop physics-informed and AI-assisted computational frameworks that couple
            thermo-mechanical finite element analysis with surrogate modeling to predict structural
            behavior under realistic fire scenarios. This includes new methods implemented and taught
            in my Stanford course CEE 284F: <i>Fire Engineering Design for Buildings</i>.
          </p>

          <p class="text1">
            <b>(2) Wildfire Exposure & Community-Scale Resilience</b><br>
            I build spatial risk models combining radiant-heat networks, ember transport, and
            probabilistic ignition to assess structure vulnerability in WUI neighborhoods. This work
            supports hazard mapping, prioritization of mitigation strategies, and land-use planning,
            and is strengthened by my role as Co-PI on the NSF RAPID project
            <i>IRIS-Wildfire</i>, which documents ignition pathways and building-to-building spread
            during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires.
          </p>

          <p class="text1">
            <b>(3) Low-Carbon Fire Design & Life-Cycle Performance</b><br>
            I investigate the trade-offs between fireproofing efficiency, structural performance,
            and embodied carbon. My recent development of <i>Fireproof Optimizer</i> (Stanford OTL
            S25-399) provides an AI-enabled platform for optimizing fire protection thicknesses while
            quantifying carbon reduction, enabling sustainable performance-based fire engineering.
          </p>

          <!-- PAST RESEARCH SECTION -->
          <h4 class="padtop2">Past Research: Advanced Modeling of Steel Connections under Fire</h4>

          <p class="text1">
            My earlier research focused on understanding the fundamental behavior of steel
            connections and composite floor systems subjected to fire, including full-scale
            structural testing and advanced nonlinear finite element modeling. As part of a
            multi-year research program supported through the FP7 Marie Curie Fellowship,
            I developed computational and experimental frameworks to investigate how connections
            contribute to the overall fire resilience of composite steel–concrete systems.
          </p>

          <div class="box-img imgindent img1" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
            <img src="relatedimages/cardington2.png" width="500" alt="Cardington Test Image">
          </div>

          <p class="text1">
            This work built upon landmark large-scale fire experiments—such as the Cardington
            Frame Tests—revealing that composite floor slabs and continuity effects can
            significantly enhance fire performance through catenary action and membrane forces.
            These mechanisms are often not captured by prescriptive design methods but are
            critical for realistic assessment of structural robustness under natural fires.
          </p>

          <h4 class="padtop">Summary</h4>

          <p class="text1">
            The overall research objective was to advance structural fire safety through improved
            prediction of the performance of buildings, bridges, and urban infrastructure exposed
            to severe fires. The work generated fundamental knowledge on the fire performance of
            structures—especially steel connections, which govern stability and integrity—and
            provided a basis for performance-based design approaches across Europe.
          </p>

          <p class="text1">
            Through experiments and computational mechanics, the research delivered insights into
            connection behavior, composite action, thermal gradients, and global stability under
            fire. It aligned with the European Research Area goals for natural hazard mitigation
            and contributed directly to developing improved design guidance.
          </p>
