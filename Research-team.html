This application also combines the heat release rate curves of the furniture items resulting in the heat release rate curve of the compartment. He is currently working on improving the accuracy of the curve with adding the fire spread time and more heat release rate data for different furniture items. He is also working on FDS studies to understand how heat flux is affected by different parameters such as distance, ventilation factor, peak heat release rate and fire area. This will help to estimate the fire spread time in dwelling rooms, which will also assist in egress work. Finally, he is suggesting a practical method to calculate fire load in dwellings using the volume and material properties of the items to create a fire risk map of Istanbul. </p>

                <p class="text1">Damage to passive fire protection systems such as fire-rated doors by seismic excitations prior to a fire event can be a critical threat in terms of the fire safety of the occupants and building property in densely populated tall buildings. Seismic cracks on corners and joints or lateral distortions in a fire door assembly can cause gaps between the door leaf and its frame, resulting in the incapability of impeding the spread of smoke and flame. The reliability of the remaining fire resistance of fire doors for the potential fires occurring after a period from the seismic activity is difficult to evaluate since their potentially reduced performance levels are not currently quantified in design codes. Muhammet is currently endeavoring to construct a seminal numerical fire door model to simulate earthquake and fire tests subsequently for validating the experimental results. He will then apply the outputs to establish a framework for repair and replacement criteria for earthquake-damaged fire doors, and to contribute to the next-generation design codes.

Generally, load bearing structural elements such as beams, columns, slabs and shear walls are designed for earthquake. Earthquake effects on fire related non-structural components such as compartment walls, elevators, fire doors and stairs are not designed for a good performance against earthquake. Mübin will estimate the damage of these components after moderate earthquake using Matlab, Sap2000 and Perform 3D. </p>
