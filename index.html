          <p class="text1"> <b>Structural Fire Engineering</b> is an important multi-disciplinary engineering field that deals with fire science and structural resistance of buildings, bridges and other infrastructure. Natural hazard mitigation is one of the funded activities in ‘Environment European Research Area’. Fire represents one of the most severe environmental hazards for the built infrastructure and it is a particularly dangerous event caused by many other hazards such as earthquake, impact and blast. 
<br><br>
         Structural Fire Safety Research Group at Bogazici University focuses on natural hazard risk mitigation through utilizing the fundamental knowledge of theoretical, computational and experimental mechanics of structures and fire science. Our research group studies the fire performance of structures, especially the fire resilience of structural steel connections in a composite floor, which provide integrity and stability to the global structural system. Further, we focus on the progressive collapse of tall buildings due to various fire scenarios. Currently, we are developing our home-grown transient heat transfer finite element software called FEHEAT. Aside from deterministic research, we seek to investigate the detrimental effect of fire to the different types of buildings and infrastructure with probabilistic approaches. Hence, we apply structural reliability tools in assessing the resilience of structures.
